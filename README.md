# Worker-Database-Case-Study
This repository contains a case study focused on designing and implementing a worker database system. The database includes tables for workers, bonuses, and titles, aimed at efficiently managing employee data within an organization.

Overview
In today's dynamic workplace environment, managing employee information is crucial for organizational success. This case study delves into the design and implementation of a relational database tailored for this purpose. The database schema comprises three primary tables:

tables:
1. Workers Table: This table stores comprehensive information about each worker, including their unique identifier, name, contact details, department, position, and hire date. Additionally, it may include fields for salary, performance ratings, and other relevant metrics.
2. Bonuses Table: Tracking bonuses is essential for recognizing and rewarding employee performance. The bonuses table captures data related to bonus distributions, such as the worker ID, bonus amount, date awarded, and any associated remarks or criteria.
3. Titles Table: As employees progress within an organization, their roles and responsibilities may evolve. The titles table maintains a record of various job titles, along with their corresponding levels, descriptions, and any hierarchical relationships.

Technologies Used
1. Database Management System: Utilize a relational database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to create and manage the database schema.
2. SQL: Leverage SQL (Structured Query Language) for defining schema, querying data, and performing data manipulation operations.
3. Version Control: Employ Git for version control to track changes, collaborate with team members, and maintain a history of modifications.
